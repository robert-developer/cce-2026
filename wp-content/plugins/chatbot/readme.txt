Here is a short guideline for [How to reduce OpenAI API cost for your ChatBot](https://wpbot.pro/docs/knowledgebase/how-to-save-money-and-reduce-openai-api-cost-for-your-chatbot/)

= Getting Started with OpenAI =
Once you add the OpenAI API key, the WPBot should already start working for generic questions. Open a new browser window in Incognito mode and test by asking "What is the capital of Japan?"

Please make sure DialogFlow is Disabled if you want OpenAI to work with the WPBot.

= OpenAI not working. WPBot Keeps loading =
If OpenAI is not responding back and the bot is just loading, then likely you hit your OpenAI API usage limit or need to add credit. Please <strong><pre-purchase credit</strong> to use OpenAI API and increase the Usage limit. You can add credits to your API account from here: https://platform.openai.com/account/billing

= How to get an OpenAI API Key for the WPBot? =
Visit your OpenAI API Keys page to retrieve the API key. You can grab the API key for the WPBot from this page: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

= Can I use both DialogFlow and OpenAI GPT3 with the WPBot? =
No. They will both NOT work together. Please disable DialogFlow if you want OpenAI to work for the WPBot.

= Is my language supported? =
WPBot can work with ANY language. Just change the language texts from the WPBot Settings->Change Language to your preferred one. 

= Does this ChatBot support multi language? =
MultiLanguage is supported with the WPBot Pro Master License. For a multilingual ChatBot for international users grab the WPBot.Pro Master License

= I am not getting emails from the WPBot =
The WPBot WPBot uses the WordPress' default email function. If you are not getting emails from the WPBot's email feature, it is likely that no emails are getting through from your WordPress site or they are ending up in the Spam box. Try using an SMTP mailer plugin. Also, try changing the to and from email addresses in the WPBot's general settings area.

= I cannot connect the WPBot to DialogFlow =
Please Follow the steps in this tutorial correctly: https://www.wpbot.pro/dialogflow-integration/

= Simple text responses are not working or getting an error =
WPBot requires mysql version 5.6+ for the simple text responses to work. If your server has a version below that, you might see some PHP error or the Simple Text Responses will not work at all. Please request your hosting support to update the mysql version on your server.

= I changed language or some other settings but do not see them when testing =
Please clear the browser cache and <strong>cookies</strong> to see any change you have made. Alternatively, you can open a fresh browser window in incognito mode (Ctrl+Shift+N in chrome) to test your changes. Also, you may need to purge any cache plugin and CDN caching.

= The WPBot is NOT working in the front end. =
The most common reason for this is if the theme is coded incorrectly and jQuery is loaded from external source. jQuery is included with WordPress core and according to WordPress standard, jQuery must be included using wp_enqueue_script. https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_enqueue_script/ . Please make sure if that is the case in your theme. 

Please contact us if you need [further help](https://www.wpbot.pro/free-support/). We take all user feedback sriously.
